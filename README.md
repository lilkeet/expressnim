# stepnim
Implementing ISO 10303-11, 21, and 22 in Nim (STEP + EXPRESS files).

The project is still under development.
The goal is to create a full implementation of ISO 10303-11, 21, and 22 in Nim.
That is: parse EXPRESS files and thereby STEP files, and provide an SDAI api for
ease of use.
There really aren't that many of these types of programs around! Especially
open-source ones.
The hope is that this will lead to some much need innovation in the CAD
industry.
